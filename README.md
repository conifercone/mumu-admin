## Projects

> Although there are many mature backend management systems on the market,
> my strong preference for clean code has made it difficult to find a suitable project.
> So, I decided to create my own open-source backend management system that is both clean and
> feature-complete.
> This led to the creation of "mumu," named after my son (沐沐).
> Just as I hope for my child's healthy growth, I also wish for the mumu-admin project to thrive.
> For as long as I live, this project will remain free and open-source for both individuals
> and organizations to use without any charges.
